# Poem in rimes
Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne

A new line for the poem
tryin to work with git
I may have a problem
If i cannot commit

#Hello stive 

## A New Beginning

In the quiet of the night, **dreams take flight**.  
Words weave stories, illuminating the dark.  
Every line a heartbeat, echoing the light.
